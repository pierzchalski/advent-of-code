# Advent of Code 

Solutions to challenges in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).
Solutions for each year are in separate workspaces. To run the
solutions, navigate to the relevant year and run `cargo test`.  As an
example, to run the solutions for Day 1 of AOC 2019, do the following:

```bash
cd aoc2019
cargo test day1
```
